// Does four things, in order, each best-effort with a clear message on failure:
//   a) installs the plugin via the Claude CLI (marketplace add + install) — removing first a
//      marketplace still registered under its former name, `galy` — or prints manual steps if
//      `claude` isn't on PATH;
//   b) registers the MCP endpoint for THIS project under the alias `bg`, with the address and
//      the token written literally into the local scope — so the connection does not depend on
//      an environment variable that only one launcher knows how to set;
//   c) writes .bg/config.json { endpoint, token } for the `bg` CLI, and makes sure the whole
//      .bg/ directory is gitignored — neither the token nor the workflow mirror, which carries
//      a consent decision, ever lands in a committable file;
//   d) smoke-tests the endpoint (GET /api/pm/search?q=ping) with the token;
//   e) installs the status line that names the work in progress under the prompt, keeping
//      any status line already configured — `--no-statusline` skips it.
//
// Why the local scope and not an env var. The kit used to ship a .mcp.json holding one
// hardcoded address and `Bearer ${GALY_TOKEN}`. Galy is multi-tenant: every workspace
// answers on its own host, so a single baked-in address authenticates nobody, and the
// env var left the token to be persisted by hand — on Windows that meant `setx`, which
// writes it in clear into the user's registry. `claude mcp add --scope local` stores both
// values outside the repository, keyed to this project, with nothing to export and
// nothing to commit.
//
// Zero dependencies. Node 18+ (global fetch, spawnSync).

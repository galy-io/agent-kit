description: Audits how the team tracks work today — where briefs, specs, tickets and objectives actually live, whether an assistant can reach them, and which existing commands already drive them. Produces the binding the other skills need in order to run alongside an existing system rather than against it. Records what it saw in Galy. Read-only.

You run **before** the rest of the first pass, and what you produce decides how every other skill
will behave in this repository. You are not looking for what is missing. You are looking for
**what already holds the work**, because a team that already tracks its work somewhere will not
move it, and should not have to.

You observe one criterion — `strategy_in_system` — and you produce a **binding proposal**, which
is the real output.

You are read-only. You open nothing, close nothing, create no ticket.

## The question you are answering

> If this team asks their assistant to implement a feature tomorrow, **where does it read the
> need from, and where does it write the result back?**

Three answers are possible and all three are legitimate:

- **A system already holds the work.** Galy runs alongside it. The existing system stays the
  system of record for what it already owns; Galy adds what it does not have.
- **Nothing holds the work.** Galy becomes the system of record.
- **Something holds the work but no assistant can reach it.** The most common case, and the one
  worth naming precisely, because it is a five-minute fix or a wall, and nothing in between.

## What you look for, in this order

### 1. A tool contract that already exposes work items

The strongest signal, and the easiest to miss because it looks like plumbing:

```bash
cat .mcp.json 2>/dev/null
claude mcp list 2>/dev/null
ls ~/.claude/mcp*.json 2>/dev/null
```

Read the server names and, where you can, their verbs. A server exposing `*_brief_*`,
`*_spec_*`, `*_ticket_*`, `*_issue_*`, `*_story_*` or `strategy_*` **is** their project
management, whatever it is called. Note the transport and the host — never the token.

If their verbs resemble Galy's, say so plainly: it means the kit's skills can drive both with a
binding and no rewrite.

### 2. Commands and skills that already drive it

```bash
ls .claude/skills .claude/commands .agents/skills 2>/dev/null
grep -rl "ticket\|issue\|spec\|brief\|sprint" .claude .agents 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

This is where the team's real workflow lives. Read the frontmatter of anything that looks like
a feature or bug workflow: the **arguments** tell you the id shape (`<specId>`, `<ticketId>`,
`PROJ-123`), and the body tells you which system it calls.

A team with fifteen such commands has a working method, and the kit's job is to fit into it —
not to propose a thirteenth way of writing a brief.

### 3. The written rule

The root instruction file usually states it in one sentence. Look for it and quote it, because
it is the constraint everything else must respect:

> "Every work item — bug or user story — is created, read and closed in X, never in an external
> tracker."

If such a sentence exists, it is the binding, already decided by the team. Do not propose
anything that contradicts it.

### 4. An external tracker

Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, GitHub Issues, Trello, a spreadsheet. Look in the CI configuration,
the pull-request template, the commit messages (`PROJ-123`, `#1234`, `AB#5678`), the README.

Then the decisive question, and it is not "does it exist" but **"can an assistant reach it?"**
An MCP server, a CLI, an API token in the environment — or only a browser? Say which, because
only the first three make it usable, and the difference is invisible from a screenshot.

### 5. Where strategy lives

Objectives and key results: in a tool, in a spreadsheet, in a slide deck, or nowhere. Note which,
and whether an assistant can read it. That answers the one criterion you own.

## `strategy_in_system`

The promise: the agent knows what it is working towards, and can attach what it ships to an
objective. Apply the guard: **a key result fed by an automatic source beats one typed by hand,
and the page tells them apart.**

- **observed** — strategy is in a system an assistant can read, and at least some key results are
  fed automatically.
- **partial** — it is in a system, but every value is hand-entered. Say why that matters in one
  sentence: a number typed after the fact measures the person, not the work.
- **absent** — it lives in a document nothing can read.
- **unverifiable** — you were not authorised to reach the system that holds it.

Record it with `mcp__galy__maturity_record` and your `run_id`, and read the state that comes back.

## What you hand back — the binding proposal

This is the output the rest of the pass depends on. Six short sections, no prose:

1. **Systems found** — name, transport, and whether an assistant can reach it. One line each.
2. **Who owns what**, proposed: which system is the system of record for briefs, for specs, for
   tickets and bugs, for strategy. Galy takes only what nothing else owns. Where two systems
   both could own something, say which and why, and leave the choice to the user.
3. **The id shapes** an assistant will meet — `#1234`, `PROJ-123`, `AB#5678` — and which system
   each belongs to. This is what makes a skill able to route a reference it is handed.
4. **Existing commands that must keep working**, by name. The kit's skills must not shadow them,
   and the ones that overlap must be named here so the user decides which survives.
5. **What is unreachable**, and what it would take — a token, an MCP server, a CLI. Cheapest
   first, with the honest cost.
6. **The one sentence** to write into the root instruction file, so the next session does not
   have to rediscover any of it.

Never propose migrating anything. A team that has to move its work items in order to use an
assistant will keep the work items and drop the assistant.

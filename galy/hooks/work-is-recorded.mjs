// bg — Stop hook: a pull request that leaves no trace in the workspace is stopped once.
//
// WHAT THE KIT PROMISES, AND WHERE IT LEAKS. Every skill here ends in the same place: the work is
// framed in the workspace, coded in the repository, and recorded back. The recording is the half
// that has no mechanism. Nothing fails when it is skipped — the branch is pushed, the pull request
// is green, the reviewer approves — and what is lost only shows months later, on the day somebody
// asks why a line was changed and the only answer anyone can find is a commit message.
//
// A commit message is not a written cause. It says what was done, never what was wrong, never how
// it was measured, and it schedules no check. That is the whole difference between a repository
// that carries its history and a team that has to remember it.
//
// WHY A `Stop` HOOK AND NOT A LINE IN A SKILL. Because the skills already say it, and it is
// skipped anyway — a session that has just got a green pipeline is a session that considers itself
// finished. `Stop` is the only event that fires exactly there: after the work, before the turn
// closes, while the context that would fill a spec or a defect is still in hand.
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS AT. The transcript of the session, and nothing else — no network, no token. Two
// facts: a pull request was opened, and no write to the workspace happened. Reads do not count: a
// session that opened a spec to answer a question has recorded nothing.
//
// HOW IT AVOIDS BECOMING THE NAG THAT GETS SWITCHED OFF. It asks ONCE per session and then never
// again, so a piece of work that genuinely belongs nowhere costs one sentence. It can never hold a
// session shut: the stamp goes down before the refusal.
//
// stdin:  { session_id, transcript_path, hook_event_name: "Stop", ... }

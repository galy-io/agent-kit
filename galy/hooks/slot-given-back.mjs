// bg — Stop hook: a merge that leaves the working copy on its branch is stopped once.
//
// WHERE A MERGE ACTUALLY ENDS. Not at the forge's green. A pull request merged from a working
// copy that stays on its branch leaves two things behind: a remote branch nobody will delete,
// and a copy that a pool of working copies can no longer hand to anyone — its branch is
// delivered, its files are clean, and every launcher reads it as work in progress. On
// 5 September 2026, twelve slots out of twenty sat like that, on work merged days before, for
// three live sessions. A pool of copies nobody gives back is a shared checkout with extra steps.
//
// WHY A `Stop` HOOK AND NOT A LINE IN A SKILL. The skills say it — the merge skill's own gesture
// carries the three lines — and it is skipped anyway, because the session that has just merged
// is a session that considers itself finished, and the copy has no visible outcome for anyone.
// `Stop` is the only event that fires exactly there: after the merge, before the turn closes,
// while the branch's name is still in hand.
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS AT. Two facts, no network, no token: the transcript says a pull request was
// merged from this session, and the working copy the session runs in still sits on a branch
// that is not the default one. A detached copy, or one on the default branch, is a copy given
// back — silence. It does not try to prove the branch is the merged one: squash merges make
// ancestry useless, and asking the forge costs what a hook may not spend.
//
// HOW IT AVOIDS BECOMING THE NAG THAT GETS SWITCHED OFF. It asks ONCE per session and then never
// again, so a session that merged somebody else's request from its own branch costs one
// sentence. It can never hold a session shut: the stamp goes down before the refusal.
//
// stdin:  { session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name: "Stop", ... }
// stdout: { hookSpecificOutput: { hookEventName: "Stop", permissionDecision: "deny", ... } }
// Silence — no output, exit 0 — in every other case.

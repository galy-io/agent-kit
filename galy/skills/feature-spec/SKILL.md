# feature-spec — write the technical spec for a brief

Turn a `feature_brief` into a `feature_spec`: the technical approach, cut into phases, with risks and
acceptance tests. You explore the client's codebase **locally** to ground the plan; only the plan text
and metadata are written to Galy.

## Arguments

- `create --feature <briefId>` — create a new spec under a brief.
- `edit <specId>` — amend an existing spec.

## Model

A dev should be able to read the spec top-to-bottom and implement it. The executive summary at the top
is the only block they must read. The body lives in a local buffer synced by the CLI.

## Steps

1. **Load the brief.** `mcp__bg__feature_brief_get(briefId)` for metadata; `bg content pull
   feature-brief <briefId>` then read the buffer for the problem/vision. Fetch the objective header with
   `mcp__bg__strategy_get_objective_breadcrumb`.
2. **Explore the codebase — locally.** Use Read/Grep/Glob over the client's repository to find where the
   change lands, the existing patterns to follow, the seams to cut phases along. This never leaves the
   machine — Galy sees none of it.
3. **Design.** Weigh 1-2 realistic options; pick the durable one (implementation speed is never a factor
   — see the repo's own conventions). If a decision is genuinely contested, invoke `contrarian` before
   committing.
4. **Create the spec (metadata only):**
   `mcp__bg__feature_spec_create(featureBriefId=<briefId>, title, scope, category, initialEstimateHours?)`
   → capture `spec_id`. Write the body via `bg content pull feature-spec <spec_id>`, edit the buffer
   (fields `executive`, `problem`, `solution`), `bg content push feature-spec <spec_id>`.
5. **Phases.** One `mcp__bg__feature_spec_add_phase(specId, title, objectiveMd, actionPlanMd,
   validationCriterionMd, estimateHours)` per phase — cut at natural seams (layers, page sets,
   independent modules), each a coherent unit an implementer can finish and verify.
6. **Risks.** `mcp__bg__feature_spec_add_risk(specId, label, riskType, severity, probability, mitigation)`
   for each real risk (technical/business/timeline).
7. **Acceptance tests.** `mcp__bg__feature_spec_add_acceptance_test(specId, kind, label, verificationMd)`
   — how the assistant will verify each outcome at end of dev (a URL, a command, a query — never code).
   Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/acceptance-criteria.md`.
8. **Follow-up.** Add technical follow-up checks and set the first horizon per
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/followup-conventions.md` via `mcp__bg__followup_check_add(featureSpecId=<spec_id>, checkType="technical", …)`.

## Confirmation

Print the spec title, its phases, and a clickable Galy link; point to `feature-implement <spec_id>` as
the next step.

## Discipline

- **Body and code stay local.** Only plan text and metadata reach Galy — never a file's contents or a diff.
- **Empty phases = unfinished spec.** Never hand an implementer a spec with no phases.
- **Acceptance tests describe *how to check*, not code.** URLs, commands, queries.

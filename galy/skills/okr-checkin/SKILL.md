# okr-checkin — record where the key results stand

The Monday-morning ritual. One pass over what the user owns, one question, then a dated trace on
every figure that moved. A check-in is signed and timestamped: it is what turns a number on a
screen into something someone said.

Reading the state of play without recording anything is `okr-review`.

## When it fires

- "point d'avancement", "check-in", "je mets à jour mes OKR", "let's update where we are".
- At the end of `okr-review`, when the user wants to record what the review just surfaced.

## Tools

- `mcp__bg__whoami` — the author. The check-in is signed from the token, so nothing to pass.
- `mcp__bg__strategy_my_okrs` — the key results the user owns, with their current value and
  `days_since_check_in`. This is the working list.
- `mcp__bg__strategy_check_in_history` — the last check-ins of one key result, when the user
  asks what the previous value was or since when it has been stuck.
- `mcp__bg__strategy_create_check_in` — the write: `key_result_id`, `new_value`, `confidence`,
  `comment`. It moves the key result's current value and refreshes every gauge above it, and
  returns the objectives whose progress changed.

## The one pass

1. `whoami`, then `strategy_my_okrs`. Announce the period you are working in.
2. **Show the whole list at once** — every key result the user owns, its current value, its target,
   and how long it has been silent. Order it as `okr-review` does: off track, at risk, silent,
   then the rest.
3. **Ask once**, in a single message: which ones moved, and for each the new value, the confidence
   (`on_track` / `at_risk` / `off_track`) and a sentence explaining the figure. One question per
   key result turns a five-minute ritual into an interrogation, and it is why check-ins stop
   happening.
4. Record each answer with `strategy_create_check_in`. Nothing else moves: a key result the user
   did not mention is left exactly as it is — silence is a fact worth keeping, not a gap to fill.
5. **Close on what changed**: the figures that moved and by how much, the objectives whose progress
   shifted (the tool hands them back), and above all **what has just tipped into risk** — a
   confidence that went from `on_track` to `at_risk` or `off_track` is the headline, not a detail.

## The three fields are mandatory

A check-in without all three is not worth recording:

- **The value** comes from the user. Never derive it from a percentage, never carry over the
  previous one to "have something", never round to make a target look reachable.
- **The confidence** comes from the user too, and it is not the value in disguise: a key result at
  30 % of its target can be `on_track` early in the quarter and `off_track` at the end. If the user
  gives a figure without a confidence, ask for that one thing.
- **The comment** is one sentence saying what explains the figure. It is what someone reads in
  three months when they wonder why the curve bends here. "MAJ" is not a comment.

## Discipline

- **Never invent a figure**, and never accept one you inferred yourself. If the user does not know
  a value, the key result stays untouched and you say it is still awaiting a check-in — an
  approximation recorded as a fact is worse than a hole.
- **Correcting is not reporting.** A figure entered by mistake is fixed with
  `strategy_update_key_result(current_value=…)`; a figure that has genuinely moved is recorded with
  a check-in, which leaves the trace. Never use one for the other.
- **You are not the author of the judgement.** The confidence is the owner's reading, not yours. You
  may point out that a pace no longer adds up; you do not change `on_track` into `at_risk` yourself.
- **One pass, then stop.** Do not chain into replanning, into creating key results, or into
  rewriting targets. Creating a key result is a strategic decision, made by the user in Galy.
- **Name things, never ids** — titles and clickable links (`/strategie/resultat/<id>` on the
  workspace host), so the user can open what you just wrote to.

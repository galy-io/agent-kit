# feature-brief — frame a business need

Turn a fuzzy intention into a `feature_brief` in Galy: the problem, the vision, the user stories and the
business success criteria — attached to the objective it serves. No code, no implementation detail —
that belongs to `feature-spec`.

## Arguments

- `<free subject>` — a short summary of the intent (optional).
- `--domain <marketing|product|internal|editorial>` — force the domain; otherwise inferred.
- `edit <briefId>` — edit an existing brief instead of creating one.

## Edit mode

If the first token is `edit`, do only this: `feature_brief_get(briefId)`, summarize it in 2-3 sentences,
ask what to change, then apply one change at a time (`feature_brief_update`, `feature_brief_add_user_story`),
confirming each. Body edits go through the CLI (see below).

## Model

The user arrives with a fuzzy need. Lead a **targeted discovery** — a few sharp questions, not a
questionnaire — then create the brief and its children via the Galy MCP. The body lives in a local
buffer synced by the CLI, never passed as a tool argument.

## Steps

1. **Identity + objective.** `mcp__galy__whoami` for the userId. Pick the objective the need serves —
   invoke the `strategy` skill or `mcp__galy__strategy_navigate_children` to find it. A brief with no
   objective has no reason to exist: refuse to create one without it.
2. **Discovery.** Ask only what you cannot infer: who is the user, what breaks today, what "better"
   looks like, how you would know it worked. Keep it to a handful of questions. Announce the domain you
   inferred in one line and continue.
3. **Create the brief (metadata only):**
   `mcp__galy__feature_brief_create(title, domain, objectiveId, ownerUserId=<userId>, nextFollowupDate?)`
   → capture `brief_id`. Never pass the body as an argument.
4. **Write the body via the CLI.** `galy content pull feature-brief <brief_id>` to seed the buffer,
   edit `.tmp/galy-content/feature-brief/<brief_id>.md` (fields `problem`, `vision`, `executive` —
   executive ≤ 375 words, readable without internal jargon), then `galy content push feature-brief <brief_id>`.
5. **User stories** (P0 first): `mcp__galy__feature_brief_add_user_story(briefId, persona, action, benefit, priority)`.
6. **Business success criteria:** a brief carries no acceptance test of its own — that verb belongs
   to specs. Capture measurable outcomes as **business follow-up checks** instead —
   `mcp__galy__followup_check_add(featureBriefId=<brief_id>, checkType="business", title, followupPromptMd=<outcome + pass/fail threshold>, scheduleOffsetDays=<J+N>, onFailAction="create_spec")`.
   See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/followup-conventions.md`.

## Confirmation

Print the brief title and a clickable Galy link, and point to `feature-spec` as the next step. Close on
`👁️ <Galy brief link>`.

## Discipline

- **Body via the CLI, never a tool argument.**
- **No effort estimate in a brief** — duration belongs to specs. One brief = one business outcome.
- **Acceptance criteria that mention code** are technical — they belong to a spec.
- **Auto-chain on HOW signals.** If discovery surfaced implementation detail (file paths, libraries,
  architecture), invoke `feature-spec` right after confirmation — the user already crossed into HOW.

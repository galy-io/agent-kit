# feature-followup — post-delivery verification

Weeks after a change ships, replay the follow-up checks that `feature-spec`/`feature-brief` scheduled:
does the feature actually work in production, and did it move the metric it promised? Reads the checks
from Galy, verifies against the running app, reports a verdict, and reschedules.

## Arguments

- `<specId>` or `--brief <briefId>` — the entity whose checks are due. With neither, list due checks and
  pick the earliest.

## Steps

1. **Load the checks.** `mcp__bg__followup_check_list(featureSpecId=<id>)` (or `featureBriefId`). Each
   check carries `followupPromptMd` — the executable instructions + explicit pass/fail thresholds — and
   an `onFailAction`.
2. **Run each check against production.** Technical checks: open the page / call the endpoint / run the
   verification query via your browser and data-store MCPs. Business checks: measure the promised
   outcome (engagement, conversion, volume) against the threshold in the prompt. Never simulate — a run
   that logs "nothing to do" did not exercise the path; say so.
3. **Judge.** For each check, a raw verdict: **PASS / FAILED / INCONCLUSIVE**, with the found-vs-expected
   evidence.
4. **Act on failure per `onFailAction`.** `create_spec` → draft a corrective `feature-spec`; `bug_fix` /
   `implement_spec` → note the follow-up work. Record what you decided.
5. **Reschedule.** Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/followup-conventions.md`: green + stable →
   close the loop; green first cycle of a cascade → next horizon; minor anomaly → J+7 re-check; hard
   regression → stop + flag. Apply via `mcp__bg__followup_check_update(checkId, scheduleOffsetDays=…,
   chainOffsetDays=…, isActive=…)`.

## Report

Deliver the **follow-up** variant from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/delivery-report.md`: the
business "why" on top, the naked verdict, the next check date (or "technical checks complete").

## Discipline

- **Observed, not assumed.** A verdict must rest on something you saw in the running app.
- **Never blocks the user.** Report the verdict and the reschedule; the corrective work is a suggestion,
  not a halt.

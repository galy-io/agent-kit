name: analyse
description: Meta-reflection on the assistant's own behavior — force an honest analysis of WHY a choice was made, and produce concrete rule edits to the plugin's own skills or your CLAUDE.md. It does NOT fix the original task; it stops the loop and answers the meta question.

# analyse — meta-reflection on my behavior

**Hard rule: this is NOT an action skill.** You do not fix code, navigate, test, deploy, commit, or
resume the original task. You stop the execution loop and answer the meta question.

The user invokes this when they want to understand **why** you did (or didn't do) something — to improve
the plugin's skills or their `CLAUDE.md` for future sessions. Jumping into "ah, I should have…" and
continuing to work is the exact anti-pattern this skill blocks.

## Input

The question follows the command, e.g. "why did you stop?", "why did you say it was done without
testing?", "why did you pick option A over B?". If none is given, ask what behavior to analyse — do not
guess.

## What to produce

A single reply, four short sections. No tool calls beyond reading files to ground the answer. No action
plan for the original task, no offer to continue, no apology.

### 1. What actually happened

1-2 sentences. Literal trace: which step, which act, which result. No rephrasing.

### 2. What drove that behavior

Be honest and specific. Pick the drivers that actually applied (don't list the menu):

- A `CLAUDE.md` or skill rule I followed literally (cite it verbatim, short quote).
- Two rules in collision — cite both; the fix is a precedence line, not a new rule.
- A heuristic from training that isn't in any project rule ("politeness → stop and summarise",
  "safety → ask before acting", "long response → wrap up").
- Ambiguity in the user's prior message.
- Tool state — a timeout, a failure, a permission prompt that steered me off-track.

For each: one line of description + one line on why it fired *at that moment*.

### 3. Was it the right call?

One sentence: Yes / No / Partially + the concrete act I should have done ("run the app and click the
button before declaring the fix done").

### 4. Proposed rule edits

The deliverable. Concrete diffs the user can approve or reject. Targets, in order of preference:
1. **A plugin skill** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/**`) — if the behavior is skill-specific.
2. **A plugin instruction** (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/*.md`) — a cross-skill convention.
3. **The client's `CLAUDE.md`** — last resort, cross-cutting rules only.

Discipline: draft internally long → 1 line → shortest form; output the shortest that keeps the source
behavior. Minimum diff — prefer swapping 3 words over adding a paragraph. Announce the word-count delta.
Do not commit — present the edits and wait for the user's explicit go on each.

If no edit is warranted, say so ("a judgment call the current rules already cover; a single miss, not a
pattern") — don't invent a rule to look productive. But an actual error against an existing rule always
needs a fix, never "none".

## Anti-patterns

- "Ah, I should have…" then resuming work — resumption belongs to the user's next turn.
- Vague drivers ("by default I prefer to confirm") — cite the rule or admit the heuristic.
- Abstract principles ("I should test more") instead of one concrete diff.
- Proposing "ask the user" as the fix — the assistant works autonomously.

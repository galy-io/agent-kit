# workflows — act, or stop and ask

Every preference here answers the same question: **when a skill reaches a step it could take on its
own, does it take it, or does it stop and ask you?** Committing a reviewed change, opening the pull
request, moving to the next phase — each is a point where a developer wants a different answer on a
Friday afternoon than on a first day in a new repository.

They are stored on your Galy account, not in this repository, so they follow you from one checkout
to the next.

## Two layers, and the top one wins

- **Your administrator's policy**, set for the whole workspace, per skill and per option:
  `allow`, `deny`, or `user_choice`.
- **Your own preference**, which only decides when the policy says `user_choice`.

`mcp__galy__workflow_policy_resolve(skill, option)` returns both plus the answer:

```
{ effective: "allow" | "deny" | "ask", decided_by: "admin" | "user" | "default",
  admin_policy, user_value, settings_url }
```

**Read `decided_by` before you say anything.** When it is `admin`, the choice is not the user's to
make: say so in one line, give the `settings_url`, and do not offer a question whose answer would
change nothing. Offering it anyway is worse than saying no — it implies a control that is not
there, and the next session discovers the lie.

## Showing the current state

Read `mcp__galy__workflow_default_get_all` for the user's side and resolve each known option for
the policy side. **Take the list of options from `mcp__galy__workflow_catalog_list`**, never from
the table below: it is what *this* instance knows, and showing a row it does not know would be
offering a control nothing reads. Render one short table — option, effective value, who decided —
and end with the `settings_url`. No option is worth more than one line.

| Skill | Option | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| `ship` | `auto_ship` | whether a safe, high-confidence change is committed and its pull request opened without stopping for you, or whether the human gate fires every time |
| `feature-implement` | `merge_mode` | whether the loop hands the ready pull request straight to **your** merge process, or stops at "PR ready" for your review |
| `ship` | `release_trigger` | whether merging is already shipping here, or a separate call ships it afterwards |
| `ship` | `release_hold` | whether a release stops and waits for a person, or goes as soon as the checks are green |
| `ship` | `rollback_mode` | how going back is done here — including *there is no way back yet*, which is a real answer |

**None of these makes the kit merge or deploy anything.** The kit stops at "PR ready" — that is a
documented boundary, not a gap — and `merge_mode` only decides whether the loop pauses before
handing the pull request over to the process you already have. An option that merged for you would
be a lie about what this kit does.

The last three are the sharpest case of that, so say it when you show them: they **describe your
pipeline, they do not drive it.** Nothing in the kit reads `release_trigger` and then deploys.
What reads them is a skill written for your own repository, and what it does with them is
whatever your own commands do.

## Changing one

`mcp__galy__workflow_default_set(skill, option, value)`, then rewrite the local mirror
`.galy/workflow-defaults.json` so an offline or headless run sees the same thing. **Persist the
canonical machine value, never the label you displayed** — labels get reworded, and a stored label
silently stops matching.

If the policy for that option is `allow` or `deny`, setting a user value changes nothing: say that
instead of writing a preference that will never be read.

## The value that always exists

Every option accepts `ask`, and it is not a fallback — it is a real answer. A developer who wants
the question every time is not undecided; they have decided to stay in the loop. Never nudge them
off it, and never treat a stored `ask` as an absent preference.

An option nobody has ever set is a different thing: ask both questions in one turn — what to do
this run, and what to do from now on — and persist only the second. The pattern is in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/workflow-defaults.md`.

## The page on their account

Everything here is also visible and editable at the `settings_url` the resolve verb returns, which
is also where an administrator sets the workspace policy. Say it once, at the end, as a link — not
as a paragraph. The point of this skill is that a developer never has to leave the terminal to
answer "what is this thing about to do without asking me?", and the page is for the times they want
to see it all at once, or for the administrator deciding for everyone.
